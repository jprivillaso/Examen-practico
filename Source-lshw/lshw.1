.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlshw\fR [ \fB-version\fR ] [ \fB-help\fR ] [ \fB-html\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBlshw\fR
is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware
configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory
configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, 
CPU version
and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc. on 
DMI-capable x86
systems and on some PowerPC
machines (PowerMac G4 is known to work).
.PP
It currently supports DMI (x86 only), OpenFirmware device tree (PowerPC only),
PCI/AGP, CPUID (x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI, PCMCIA (only tested on x86) and SCSI.
.PP
.TP
\fB-version\fR
Displays the version of \fBlshw\fR and exits.
.TP
\fB-help\fR
Displays the available command line options and quits.
.TP
\fB-html\fR
Output the device tree as an HTML page.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBlshw\fR currently does not detect 
USB or Firewire(IEEE1394) devices.
.PP
Not all architectures supported by GNU/Linux are fully supported (e.g.
CPU detection).
.PP
"Virtual" SCSI interfaces used for USB mass storage and SCSI emulation over IDE are not reported correctly yet.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBlshw\fR must be run as super user or it will only report
partial information.
